# Flies, but it's NYN姐贵 flying instead.

A hyper-realistic fly- I mean, flying NYN姐贵 simulator. Wait, where was that swatter again...

```
nyn.exe options:

-c      --count Count of flies to display, default is 1 (more flies = more lag)
-d      --delay Delay (in seconds) until the flies appear (0-86400)
-h      --help  Show this message and exit
```

To close it, simply press Alt+F4. Alternatively, you can also just kill the `Flies.exe` (or whatever your file name you rename it) process. But do you really wanna kill those flying things?!?
